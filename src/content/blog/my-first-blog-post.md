This is my first blog post. I'm excited to share my journey with you.
All the code for this blog was created following the Astro blog tutorial.
I will be publishing content related:

- UI & UX: How to create intuitive and attractive interfaces

- Accessibility: Design and development for everyone

- Performance: Optimization for fast and scalable applications

- Fundamentals: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and best practices

- Tools and techniques I discover along the way
